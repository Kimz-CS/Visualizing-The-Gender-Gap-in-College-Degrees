# Visualizing-The-Gender-Gap-in-College-Degrees
In this project, I extend the work I did in the last project on visualizing the gender gap across college degrees. So far, we mostly focused on the STEM degrees but now we will generate line charts to compare across all degree categories. In the last step of this project, I explore how to export the final diagram we create as an image file.
